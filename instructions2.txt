Here are the instructions to test an object on the website, based only on the provided context:

**Instructions for an Automation Tester:**

1.  **Open the Website:**
    *   Navigate your web browser (or use your automation script's `driver.get()` method) to the following URL: `https://juice-shop.herokuapp.com/#/`

2.  **Verify the OWASP Juice Shop Logo Visibility:**
    *   **Locate the Image:** Use the provided XPath locator to find the logo image:
        `//img[@alt='OWASP Juice Shop']` or `/html/body/app-root/mat-sidenav-container/mat-sidenav-content/app-navbar/mat-toolbar/mat-toolbar-row/div/img`
    *   **Check for Visibility:** Assert that the located image element is visible on the page.
    *   **Verify Alt Text:** Assert that the `alt` attribute of this image element is exactly "OWASP Juice Shop".

**Regarding the "CSRF HACKED PRODUCT" Image:**

Based *only* on the provided context, there is no information (tag, text, locator, or attributes) for an image specifically identified as "CSRF HACKED PRODUCT". Therefore, it is not possible to provide instructions to test its visibility, alt text, or if a placeholder is showing using *only* the given context. The provided context only includes details for an image with `alt="OWASP Juice Shop"`.
