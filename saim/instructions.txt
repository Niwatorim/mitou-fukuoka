Here are the detailed instructions to test the Vite logo:

1.  **Open the Website:**
    *   Navigate your web browser or automation script to `http://localhost:5173/`.

2.  **Locate the Vite Logo Element:**
    *   Using your automation framework, identify the image element associated with the Vite logo. You can typically do this by its `alt` attribute (`alt="Vite logo"`) or by its position within the `<a>` tag that links to `https://vite.dev`.

3.  **Verify Logo Visibility:**
    *   Assert that the Vite logo image is present and visible on the webpage.

4.  **Verify Logo Attributes:**
    *   Check that the `src` attribute of the image element points to the correct Vite logo asset (e.g., `/vite.svg`).
    *   Confirm that the `alt` attribute of the image element is correctly set to "Vite logo".

5.  **Verify Link Functionality:**
    *   Identify the parent `<a>` tag of the Vite logo image.
    *   Assert that the `href` attribute of this `<a>` tag is `https://vite.dev`.
    *   Assert that the `target` attribute of this `<a>` tag is `_blank` (indicating it should open in a new tab/window).
    *   Simulate a click on the Vite logo.
    *   Verify that a new browser tab or window opens.
    *   In the new tab/window, assert that the URL loaded is `https://vite.dev`.
    *   After you verify the link, stop and close the browser.

6.  **Generate the test code:**
    * Write the step by step playwright code script of the actions that just performed. 
    *   Example: 
        from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright, expect
        with sync_playwright() as p:
            browser = p.chromium.launch(headless=False)
            page = browser.new_page()
            page.goto("https://www.example.com")
            heading_element = page.locator("h1")
            expect(heading_element).to_have_text("Example Domain")
            context.close()
            browser.close()
    * Now it's your turn.
